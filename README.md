# AdamAsmaca - Hangman Game in Java

This Java project implements a simple hangman game, where the player needs to guess a word by providing individual letter guesses. The words are loaded from a file, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Esforper/AdamAsmaca.git
    cd AdamAsmaca
    ```

2. Compile and run the Java program:

    ```bash
    javac AdamAsmaca.java
    java AdamAsmaca
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the hangman game.

## Gameplay

- The game starts with a randomly selected word, and the player needs to guess the letters.
- The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before losing the game.
- The game notifies the player about the remaining guess count and displays the partially guessed word.

## Configuration

The words for the game are loaded from the "kelimeler.txt" file. Ensure that the file contains a list of words, each on a new line.
